Absorbing ES6
=============

I decided to learn ES6 properly, brick-and-mortar, from the ground up - using this: [https://www.udemy.com/javascript-es6-tutorial/learn/v4/]. So why not take you along for the ride?

I'm also familiarizing myself with Karma + Jasmine + PhantomJS, so a lot of the tests might seem downright riddiculous.
